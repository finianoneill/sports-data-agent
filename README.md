# Sports Data Agent

This repository contains a workflow that leverages OpenAI models and Langchain to create an agent to download and structure data about particular sports that could subsequently be leveraged by a ML classification based pipeline to predict the outcome of sports events.

## Features

- **Sports Data Agent**: TBD

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: This project utilizes LangChain, a framework for building applications with large language models. It provides tools and utilities for creating agents, tools, and chains to interact with LLMs.

- **AgentOps**: AgentOps is a platform for managing and monitoring LangChain agents. It is used in this project to track and record the agent's activities, enabling better monitoring and debugging.

- **OpenAI**: OpenAI's XXX model is used...
